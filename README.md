Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code assumes that the data is located in the working directory and is unzipped.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables used by the script, as well as the cleaning of the data done.

`run_analysis.R` is the actual script used.

The output of the script is named `averages_data.txt` and is also found in the Getting_and_Cleaning_Project repo.
