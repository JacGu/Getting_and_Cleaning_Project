Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repo contains the script and documentation for the course project "Getting and Cleaning data"

The script was used on the following data: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The code assumes that the data is located in the working directory and is unzipped. 
The R package "plyr" must be installed for the script to run properly.

## Files

`run_analysis.R` is the script itself.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables used by the script, as well as the cleaning of the data done.

`tidy_data.txt` is the output file of the script, as used on the raw data.
