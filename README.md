Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repo contains the script and documentation for the course project "Getting and Cleaning data"

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The R package "plyr" must be installed for the script to run properly.

## Files

The code assumes that the data is located in the working directory and is unzipped.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables used by the script, as well as the cleaning of the data done.

`run_analysis.R` is the actual script used.

The output of the script is named `tidy_data.txt` and is also found in the Getting_and_Cleaning_Project repo.
